# linux_notes
Place to write down things I learn about Linux

Most OS specific commands I use will be Fedora (Gnome) specific, and sometimes Debian/Ubuntu headless server specific. 

I am learning linux, and this time I decided to take notes on PC instead of my preferred way of writing on sheets of paper. This is somewhat out of my comfort zone, but have lost too many notes over time because somehow I move a lot and end up taking photos of notes on paper and then discarding the physical copies. I will be very happy if this works out well.

I thought of using a notes app (Joplin) for this, but git felt more appropriate for this topic.

Note for anyone who comes across this repo: Do not use this repo for learning. Learn from so many others who know Linux much better.
